unit 1 number guessing game
This program is designed to play a number guessing game with the user. 
They are meant to select a number between 1 and 10 and hope that they guess the same number as the computer.
The program should ask for a number and return the number of guesses as well as the high score .
The progam will continue to ask until the user gets the number correct.
It then should ask if they want to continue playing or not and loop back around if they do.
